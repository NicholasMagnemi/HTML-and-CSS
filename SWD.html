			<p class="content"> Our first excursion was to travel to Dolphin Cove in Montego Bay, to swim with the dolphins! Something everyone in our family wanted to do. First, we visited the Ostriches and Camels, fed them carrots and took pictures.  Then we geared up with life vests and instructions from the crew about how to interact with our dolphin.  We entered the water and got the chance to pet him as he swam by.  Then each of us swam out and grabbed on and got a dolphin rid back in which was very exciting. Next, we swam out and the dolphin came up behind us and with his nose pushed us through the water by our feet and at the end launched us up into the air!  The dolphins are very gentle, and they are smart the handlers and trainers were also very nice and helpful.  When I think about the tricks and splashes, it brings a smile. </p>
